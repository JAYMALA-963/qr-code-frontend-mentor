## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Frontend Mentor QR Code Component challenge. The challenge involved creating a QR code component using HTML and CSS. As this was my first CSS challenge done independently, I faced some difficulties due to my lack of experience in writing CSS. Despite this challenge, I put forth my best effort to match the output with the expected design.

### What I learned

Since this was my first-ever CSS challenge done independently, it took me more time to solve. I had never written any kind of CSS by myself before, so it was a bit challenging for me. However, I persevered and tried my best to match the output with the expected design.
